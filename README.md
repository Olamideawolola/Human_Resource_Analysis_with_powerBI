## Introduction

INTRODUCTION: This **HR analytics** project examines the dynamics of employee attrition within an organization, focusing on two key dimensions. Firstly, I explore the socio-economic characteristics such as age group, gender, and marital status that shape the attrition landscape. Secondly, I analyzed influential factors like business travel, work-life balance, and relationship satisfaction to unravel the underlying contributors to employee departures. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain actionable insights that inform strategic decision-making for talent retention and organizational well-being.
